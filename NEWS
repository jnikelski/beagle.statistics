New in Version 1.2
======================
* added the *opt* argument to a few functions, in addition to some extra debugging code.

New in Version 1.0
======================
* package renamed from lorisStatistics

New in Version 0.7.6
======================
* modified selected logging functions to accept settings being passed as an argument
* created "read_loris_aggregated_settings" to read the new aggregated settings file (in JSON)

New in Version 0.7.5
======================
* added new functions to implement the new centralized Loris logging functionality

New in Version 0.7.0
======================
* many changes related to implementation of multiple reference tissues

New in Version 0.6.3
======================
* changed rminc2 package name (rminc2 --> rmincIO)

New in Version 0.6.2
======================
* modified function vbm_quantify_by_roi.R to compute 
  average (mean/median) z-scores by ROI. I also
  removed some superfluous volume reads.

New in Version 0.6.1
======================
* added function vbm_quantify_by_roi.R for VBM quantification

New in Version 0.6.0
======================
* changed rminc version (RMINC --> rminc2)

New in Version 0.5.2
======================
* modified mincIO.readVolume functions calls to explicitly use the
  "volumeType" argument for functional, label, and mask volumes

New in Version 0.5.1
======================
* changed label read function to read the new label csv file, 
  extended by 1 column (secondary_label).  The secondary label
  column is set to 1, IFF the label redefines an area that has
  already been defined using another label.
     We need to know whether multiple labels are labelling the same
  region because, in such a case, totalling all ROI volumes would
  over-estimate total volume.  With this column, we can get an
  accurate estimate of total labelled volume by not including
  the multiply labelled areas multiple times.

New in Version 0.5
======================
* package name changed from ldiPibStatistics to lorisStatistics
  in recognition of the multi-modal nature of the processing
  and the inter-dependency of the package on the Loris
  pipeline
* version number has been shot up in recognition that we're
  using this package in production. 

New in Version 0.2
======================
* changed all calls to mincIO functions to use the new 
  mincIO.* naming convention.

New in Version 0.1
======================
* new code placed into a package for the first time.
* tested the bazaar commit mechanism
